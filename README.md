# cli-hacking-simulator
Mr. Robot hacking simulation environment

## What is this?
This is a small program that will make it look like you're hacking (like in Mr. Robot). It is very small and can be modified very easily, enjoy making your own hacking scene with ease!

## What to run it on?
I ran it on Linux Mint 19.3 and compiled it with g++... If you want to use it on Windows, you'll have to modify a few things, I don't know what these things are since I only use Linux, but good luck.
